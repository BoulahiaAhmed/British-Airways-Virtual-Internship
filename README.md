I participated in a virtual internship with British Airways, which consisted of two tasks. The first task was focused on data analysis and visualization, where I reviewed and visualized data to gain insights. The second task was about feature engineering, where I transformed and selected features to improve the model performance, and building predictive models to make predictions based on the data.
